# Optical Character Recognition
To use code you need \n
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to setting enviroment for our code.
`python main.py` on command prompt to run code.

In file main.py. You can see two parameters are "craft_mlt_25k.pth" and "TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-CTC.pth". This is file weight of model. "craft_mlt_25k.pth" is weight of detect text model and "TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-CTC.pth" is weight of recognition model.

You can find two file weight at here:
